										<h2 id="content">ProÔ¨Åcient Skills</h2>
										<p>Media and Game Arts are the two major topics to which I have dedicated my academic studies for many years. I worked for SOLIDWORKS as a product drafter, in the industrial manufacturing eld briey between my studies and also freelanced as a graphic designer. Recently, I have developed an interests in computer programming and have been researching various media that can combine technology, arts and design.</p>
										
										<u><h4>Game Arts</h4></u>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/VideoGame/web/AlienCreature/Rifle_01.png" alt="" /></span>I am also passionate about game development as a side interest, with a focus on producing video games as an environment concept artist. My thesis proposal for the MFA program at the Academy of Art University is the strongest demonstration of my ability. Additionally, my portfolio contains over 30 creations and drawings in both 2D and 3D forms. These works include illustrations, digital sculptures, texture works, an ample quantity of environment concepts, three projects that use game engines, and a vertical mini game designed in Flash. In addition to my expertise in digital drawing, I am capable of working with multiple software programs and learning new ones as necessary to leverage the tools necessary to bring my ideas to life</p>

										<u><h4>Media Design</h4></u>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Media/MobileUI/Cover.png" alt="" /></span>In the early stage of my work in media design, I mostly worked in static graphics, but recently, I have begun to transition into producing more elaborate  forms with intricate human interactions. I do UI/ UX design, website development, and creations in artistic milieus, all of which I have demonstrated in various projects. Being able to use programming technology to produce digital arts and designs to deliver quality media to the audience/user has been a strong motivator for me. With a  background as a visual artist and with competency in a number of software programs, I have been dedicating my time and energy to interactive  media by using various programming and markup languages, including C+ +, HTML, and CSS. I have completed a website redesign and independently developed a video, and I have plans for other similar activities in the future.

										<br><u><h4>Work Experience</h4></u>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/WorkingEx/Gear_Fig2-1.png" alt="" /></span>I have been employed in a start-up company as a junior UI/-UX designer for a self-developed media platform. I volunteered at a local hospital managing data  during college, I performed similar work as an IT engineering assistant at Actron Technology in 2018. Additionally, I worked in the plasticmanufacturing business at Titanic Co. Ltd., achieving excellent results during my employment period. I have demonstrated the abilities to multitask and work in a fast-paced environment while maintaining harmonious relationships with colleagues and company executives;  such individuals are available as references upon request.</p>

										<u><h4>Projects In Development</h4></u>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Media/WebUI/cover_Web.png" alt="" /></span>I am working on developing games, game art, and visual media design and learning to program in JavaScript as well as Git, I am also working to learn back-end data maintenance. Meanwhile, I am engaged in a major project with Professor Lian-Wang Lee concerning his research in Physical Rehabilitation. I was motivated to study back-end topics when I was assigned to create an algorithm to manage human interaction with computers. The assignment forced me to realize just how limited my knowledge was and how unpredictable the demands of users can be.</p>

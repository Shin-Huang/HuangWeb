										<p>This is a thesis proposal for a self-created video game that is focused on presenting visual concepts for game art. I propose to make art that combines two dierent visual styles: realism and science ction. The main purpose is to give the player a new experience of various visual elements during game play.

												<h3>Overview</h3>
												<p>This video game will combine two different visual styles; realistic mixed with science fiction. The main purpose is to bring the player into a new vision of experiencing the various cisual contents within the game play.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Game World</h3>
												<p>The historical context of the game is the World War I period (early 1900 's); the setting is a suburb of London, England. The alien world is another setting that overlaps with the human world. By going through the “Gate,” which is secretly located in London, the player can travel between these two worlds. 
												</p>
											</div>											
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Narrative</h3>
												<p>The main character, Marvin, is a British businessman who owns a major military factory in a suburb outside London. After Marvin has just nished another business deal, he walks back to his oce, by a dierent path than usual and passes by an abandoned depot. Marvin has been thinking about buying this place to store illegally traded goods. He accidentally discovers a secret passage inside the building that leads to a world he has never seen before. He nds its inhabitants are not from this world, but the world in which they are living seems to be overlap with our world. Moreover, he overhears a plan for an attack on Earth by these creatures, who are aiming to eliminate Earth and the entire human race to replace them...					
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Game Play and Mechanics</h3>
												<p>The game is a third-person action- adventure game, with controls similar to those of other video game, such as Uncharted. The main idea of combining two visual worlds is inspired by what the early Silent Hill games accomplished. The player will have to confront alien and human enemies by switching between two dierent worlds. This video game is planned to be built in an independently developed engine.

											<br><p>Colour- rendering and drawing compositions were a challenge. Limited resources and tutorials concerning how to create concept art for 	video games were provided in the program to assist me in overcoming visual issues.

											<h4>Environment Concept_Interior</h4>
											<p> The environment, including an office layout, was rendered in dierent colours.  <br> The alien world was bounded with narrative setup.</p>

													<p>The judging panel for the thesis presentation, said that the concepts were not practical for the gaming industry because most 		companies would prefer to use types of illustrations dierent from the type presented. The presented art was not considered to be 	useful "concept art" for the industry.

															<p>As a concept artist, the core task is to provide the art director with conceptual drawings to furnish ideas for the game 	project. For one nished piece, more than 20 thumbnails and six full-scale drawings were created. The process required 		time and brainstorming; the nal result was satisfying.

																<p>In this part, the aim was to deliver the conceptual form of the alien character and its corresponding vehicle. The 		main purpose was to present the organic form of both alien creations. The aim for the vehicle was to portray it in a 	living form, in contrast to the traditional materialistic, robotic style. It was a challenge because of the limited 	number of similar- designs that appeared at that time.

With the help of a 3D model done in Z-Brush, a diversity of angles were easily provided; furthermore, 		there were two other colour variations that subtly indicate the status of this weapon.
